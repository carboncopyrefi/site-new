Our inaugural report on the state of Web3 regenerative finance (ReFi) is the first known industry report on the topic. In it, we aim to give readers both inside and outside the space a better sense of the ReFi space, its ambitions, and the progress it has made to date.

More specifically, we look at:

- What ReFi Is and How It Works
- The ReFi Landscape
- Trends & Market Potential
- Opportunities & Challenges
- Case Studies
- Future Outlook

We conclude by posing four big questions for the ReFi space to answer in 2024, along with a few suggestions of our own.
