  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <span class="text-secondary fst-italic">"By shifting the direction of capital away from extractive practices toward a regenerative flow, projects and companies that provide social, environmental, or communal benefits—and which might fail to achieve funding in traditional finance—can get off the ground and generate positive externalities for society much more quickly and easily."</span>

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <span class="text-secondary fst-italic">"Traditional Finance is characterized by centralization and opacity, where a few entities or "controllers" dominate decision-making and understanding of financial systems. However, ReFi fosters transparency and decentralization, empowering individuals and promoting broad financial participation."</span>

<h2 class="mt-5">Circular economy</h2>

<figure class="text-center my-4">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <span class="text-secondary fst-italic">"Studies show us that, through efficient and more circular use of materials in just four key industrial materials (cement, steel, plastics, and aluminum), circular economy strategies can help reduce global GHG emissions by 40 percent by 2050. And if we also include circular approaches within the food system, we could achieve as much as 49 percent reductions in global GHG emissions overall."</span>

<figure class="text-center my-4">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <span class="text-secondary fst-italic">"In a regenerative capitalist world, there isn’t a PowerPoint slide that can save the planet. It requires a lot more deep thinking – some of which is unlikely to be that palatable to businesses focused primarily on the bottom line."</span>

<figure class="text-center my-4">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <span class="text-secondary fst-italic">"As the world races against time to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and keep alive the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C, oil and gas companies have begun to market their products as “clean” or “carbon neutral”. Companies such as Shell, TotalEnergies and Lundin Energy have begun branding some of their products as “carbon neutral” by bundling them with carbon offsets."</span>

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <span class="text-secondary fst-italic">"UBI has a long history and has been defended from a variety of often overlapping, but occasionally conflicting, ideological perspectives.
